I am very interested in some cognitive science ideas, and I feel like I have a unique perspective to add as a Machine Learning / NLP practitioner. Specifically, I am thinking a lot about:

- [Predictive Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding)
- [#SobSquad](https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan) and [Douglas Tatryn's BioEmotive Framework](https://bioemotiveframework.com/)
- Van der Kolk / [The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score)
- [Schmidhuber's Mind Body Program](https://unlearnyourpain.com/)
- [Valery Krupnik](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valery_Krupnik)'s research
